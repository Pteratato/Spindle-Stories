In chapter three, something changes in Craig Doyle, Printing Press Shift Manager at the *LCP*.

It starts like this; I see a suspicious-looking wheel bug hurry off with a case of green juice, and judging by the dimensions it contains 24 bottles or $72 worth of green juice. He definitely did not put $72 in the sombrero, and so this looks very much like stealing.

I’m fumbling my explanation to Madison and looking around to see if anyone else spotted the theft, but no one in the crowd seems to have noticed anything. Colt Herzwin and his saxophonist continue playing, oblivious to their surroundings. The tall man from Boston is texting now, and the people close to the table with the green juice are dancing and clapping. 

Madison’s disembodied voice demands through the cell line, “What’s going on?” and, “Are you going home now?”

But Colt is the only hope I have of changing my life and writing a ground-breaking novel, so I can’t allow this injustice to stand.

“C-Colt!” I shout and wave.

But it’s no use; the trumpeter is jumping and swinging and playing notes, not at all concerned with strange middle managers shouting from the audience. I try the saxophonist, who is slightly more aware, but when I open my mouth to shout he shoots me a dirty look, and I immediately clamp my mouth shut. My forehead breaks out into a clammy sweat, and I glance after the thief to notice he’s disappeared into the crowd heading towards Gate 11.

I hesitate, wiping my brow, while Madison is saying, “Dad? Dad?”

But I have to change my life, and the only way I can change my life is by doing something different today than I would’ve done yesterday. So I shoulder gently through the crowd and follow in the direction of the wheel bug.

“I’m just g-going to see what t-train he gets on,” I tell Madison. “So I can tell Colt.”

“What kind of name is ‘Colt’?” she asks.

I navigate through the subway, weaving in and out of the ant colony, barely aware of the pressing bodies in my preoccupation with my mission. I catch sight of the wheel bug again but he’s quite far ahead at this point, and I’m already sweaty and short of breath. I pick up my pace, scanning my pass at the turnstile and hurrying to the escalator.

Normally I would never walk down an escalator, but this is a different day and a different Craig Doyle, so I push past the people and move quickly down the stairs, mumbling ‘Sorry, sorry’ to everyone I shuffle through. One lady shouts “Who do you think you are??” and I flush but, feeling the adrenaline, I reply, “Craig Doyle, ma’am; printing press manager, novelist, vigilante.”

At the bottom of the escalator now, around the corner, down a long hall, I’m starting to close the distance between myself and the wheel bug. I can see that the wheel bug is an older insect, but it’s hard to make out any details beneath the olive drab duster and cap. He’s tall, but hunched, as one would expect from a wheel bug, but maintaining a brisk pace despite his cargo. He boards the subway at Gate 14 and I have to make a decision.

But I’m feeling the magic of the pinstriping, and of my pineapple argyle socks, and the ‘courage in a bottle’ Green Juice, so the decision is an easy one. I merge into the flow of ants boarding this subway, and we swell into the train as if a single unit, then disperse to fill the container, some sitting and some standing. I sit down near the front end of the car, happy for a break, and cast glances towards the other end where the wheel bug stands.

I can see him more clearly now, but I try to keep my glances innocuous and quick, and he seems unsuspecting. At one point he looks in my direction, and I quickly avert my eyes to an advertisement near his head, squinting behind my glasses as if to read the print. 

“Yes, yes, $4.99 if we buy five hamburgers, what a savings!”

But the man isn’t paying any attention to me, and Madison hangs up the phone. I’m kind of relieved, but I keep it held to my ear to maintain some sense of disguise, and occasionally mumble some sound of assent or disagreement while I scope out this thief.

“Of course, I would love to!” I say into the receiver, and a thick caterpillar sitting next to me with a large, bristling mustache, leans over to ask, “Are you okay, fella? I think she hung up a while ago.”

“O-oh, yes,” I fumble, closing the phone. “Just practicing. Women, you know.”

“Ahhh, yes,” he agreed, with a commiserating nod. 

I resume my discreet surveillance as soon as I’m able. The wheel bug *does* look kind of mean, but… Certainly not very thief-like, in my opinion. He’s not wearing any type of mask or disguise, for one thing, except a military cap and duster. Actually, he’s rather old, older than my dad, and he’s hunched and thin like he’s been compacted. Narrow. He has a severe look in his eye behind gold-rimmed bifocals. He places the case of Green Juice on the floor and rubs his shoulders. I start to think that maybe this isn’t a theft at all.

And something weird happens– I’m a little disappointed. 

This feeling astounds me; any reasonable fellow should be relieved when a theft is not a theft. But, I thought I was doing something brave, and perhaps this is not brave at all, but I’m already here so this is a bit of a letdown. I even thought maybe I could write about this in my ground-breaking novel.

Excitement fading, I put my phone away and pull out the little notebook with the Atlas moth. On some blank lines, I pen the following;

*Craig Doyle & the Green Juice Thief*

That doesn’t sound very fantastical, I decide.

*Craig Doyle & the Subway Stealer*

Hmm….

*The Calypso Caper*

My eyes widen and my pulse quickens– this is it! This is the title of this chapter! My eyes narrow and I cast a furtive glance towards the thief – yes, yes, he *must* be a thief, because if he isn’t, this burst of inspiration, and this bravery, will go to waste and I’ll have nothing for my novel. I decide then to follow the criminal and report my findings back to Colt, and together we can prevent anyone else from being the victim of this wheel bug’s petty larceny ever again.

The thief disembarks at Bowry Yard, a popular stop not too far from the central station, and I wait a moment before filing off with some of the stragglers. It’s after 11pm now, but Bowry Yard has a lively nightlife, very hoppin’ with the young people, so to speak, and there are many lights and pedestrians, and people walking, bar-hopping, and riding those little rent-a-scooters the city added last year, and it doesn’t look strange at all for me to head off in the same direction as the wheel bug.

I feel a ping of nostalgia – I’ve dropped off and picked up Madison here a few times over the years, when she’s gone out with her friends – but I try to stay focused on my task. The wheel bug is traveling away from the stretch of bars and restaurants and into a quiet neighborhood nearby. As we travel from the commercial area into the residential area, I have to increase the distance between us to avoid arousing suspicion.

It feels as though an invisible tether connects me and the thief, and the further I grow from him, the more tenuous the string attaching us becomes. And in the quiet of the neighborhood, with all the houses with no lights on, and no people around, I start to feel very silly. I start to think that I’m not in the right place now, and I should go home. It’s a long ride back, and I will have to go to work tomorrow to make up for the time lost while the presses were down. And I think these thoughts and I drift further from the wheel bug thief, and it’s like slowly waking up from a dream.

But before I make the decision to turn around, the wheel bug crosses a yard and walks up to a two-story house. 

Now this neighborhood is not a very nice one, and the house is no different – not trashed or in disrepair, but quite old with peeling paint and some fallen gutters. A walkway bisects the front yard, and on the left side of the yard there are many decorations, including a large rainbow flag and a gnome which appears to be smoking some illegal contraband. And displayed in big letters across the front of the house there’s a large sign which reads:

*CALYPSO GREEN JUICE*
(Please inquire within or call 555-GRN-JUCE)

Complete with the logo of the grasshopper playing trumpet. 

And the wheel bug juggles the case of juice long enough to get the door open and go inside.

The door closes and I stare at it for a moment. And I stare at the *Calypso* sign for a moment. And I feel very confused, uncertain, silly, and disappointed all at the same time. The *Calypso Caper* is a farce. I should go home.

I hang my head and turn to walk back to the station.

Suddenly a series of bangs and crashes resound from inside the two-story house, followed by a string of colorful curses and a series of thumps. It sounds very much like something thin and hunched rolling down a flight of stairs, and thudding against the front door. Without thinking I hurry down the sidewalk bisecting the yard, and it’s not until I get near the porch that I realize how awkward of a position I’m in. I had stalked this guy all the way from central station to Bowry, and then followed him all the way to his house. And he probably isn’t even a thief!

I feel the clammies coming on. I hear some groaning from behind the front door, but I hesitate.
