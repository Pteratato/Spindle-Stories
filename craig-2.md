# Chapter 2


My name is Craig Doyle and I don’t know what I’m doing here.

7 emails from colt_loves_shrooms65@yeehaw.com seemed auspicious – seven is a sacred number and so I thought, just maybe, it was a sign to do something radical for once in my life. I opened the email with the bold inquiry ‘Are You PRAYING For a Change?’ because yes, yes I was.

The email read:


[Header of a grasshopper playing trumpet]

**Hello, Friend!**

**We’re a local business in your area empowering people to take control of their lives and break the shackles of the daily grind. Are you sick of every day being exactly the same? Are you tired of being walked on? Or are you just tired?**

**If you answered ‘yes’ to any of these questions, Calypso may be right for you. Calypso is a mild, but powerful, nootropic that unlocks your inner self. Calypso is sometimes referred to as ‘courage in a bottle’ and ‘the ambrosia of the gods’. Calypso is completely safe, made with organic superfoods in a perfected combination to open up the neurotransmitters in your brain and help you achieve inner peace with your Greater Self.**

**This city has a zombie problem, and those zombies are everyday workers. Don’t be a zombie, Friend. See if Calypso is right for you, it may just change your life forever.**

**Colt Herzwin**
**CEO of Calypso Green Juice**


And I then wrote this response:


**Hello, Colt Herzwin,**

**My name is Craig Doyle, I’m a Manager for the *Lansig County Press* and I think I may be interested in Calypso. I don’t know what a ‘nootropic’ is, but God has pointed me to your email, and I think that means my inner self may need to be unlocked. I’d like to know more about your product.**

**Thank you,**
**Craig Doyle**
** *Lansig County Press* Manager**


And within half an hour, Colt Herzwin sent this back:

**Hi, Friend Craig!**

**Thanks for ur interest in calypso! Ur not gonna regret this, man! Ur inner self is just waiting 4 a little help and ur gonna shine like the king u were meant 2 be. Meet me Fri-Sun at the midtown subway between 8pm-10pm @ Gate 10, can’t miss us.**

**Its the first step to seizing control of ur life.**

**Stop being a zombie, Friend**

**-Colt**

And today is Friday, so I’m here now at the subway at 9:17pm. I’m here because I really do feel like a zombie, and zombies can’t write ground-breaking novels, and maybe this is the sign from God, and maybe if I wait until tomorrow I won’t come.

I think the problem with zombies is that being a zombie makes you okay with being a zombie, and just like that click beetle there are only brief moments of clarity. These moments can be ignored, or suppressed, or just passed over, and once it’s gone you no longer have enough clarity to see the zombification. In the insect world, zombification can be caused by a parasitic infection such as *massospora cicadina*, a fungal pathogen that infects magicicadas and replaces their hindparts with spore spreaders, and I once dreamed that this terrifying parasite existed on the scale of people. It was the most horrifying experience of my life and because of this, the concept of *zombies* is associated with *m. cicadina* and a deep trauma in my soul.

I would not equate the zombification of daily routine to the zombification of *m. cicadina*, but I still feel some subtle truth touch my spirit with that phrase.

*Stop being a zombie, Friend.*

These words I keep repeating to myself whenever I suspect it’s crazy to be walking around the subway at night looking for Colt Hertwin, sender of spam mails to press managers, but Colt replied to me, which is more than a lot of real individuals do, so I want to hear him out.

The subway never sleeps, and Friday night in particular is a bustling colony of so many bodies, moving as individuals and as single unit clusters of flesh and flannel, undulating like an organism moving towards one purpose. That purpose being the perpetual human march towards progress; progress to the train, progress to home, progress to work, progress to tomorrow. The subway always reminds me of *The Farm*.

Being around so many people causes me to break out into the clammies, but I also kind of like it. It can be comforting, to be part of a colony, and there are so many other ants that no one even notices you, despite being close enough to touch. A subway whirs in at my left and its brakes screech to a stop. The doors slide open, ants swarm out, ants swarm in, and the doors slide closed, and the colony continues the perpetual march towards tomorrow.

*8pm-10pm @ Gate 10, u can’t miss us.*

I don’t have to wonder long what ‘u can’t miss us’ means; the ruckus spilling from Gate 10 is audible by Gate 7 and, sure enough, the first thing I spy over the heads of the colony is a large banner with the emblem of a grasshopper playing trumpet and the word ‘Calypso’ in a wide font. Underneath this banner were two buskers, one playing a trumpet and dancing around, the other blowing into a baritone sax and periodically kicking what appeared to be suitcase…

Interested, I weave around to the side, where the gathering is more sparse, to get a better look. My brows knit in alarm – the suitcase isn’t just any suitcase, but a vintage Rauchbach leather luggage case and it’s rigged up as a *kickdrum*! The saxophone player uses a pedal to operate the drum, thumping a heavy, solid beat behind the two brass instruments. It seems nearly sacreligious to any stalwart businessman to see such a beautiful Rauchbach abused in such a way, and yet the melody catches me and I find I don’t hate it. Maybe it’s a worthy retirement for the suitcase.

The trumpeter is an older man, but dances around spryly in imitation of his logo, swinging the instrument and blasting notes as if possessed by it, his feet always moving and sliding. The saxophonist is more stationary, but his melody tangoes with the melody of the trumpeter in a complex back-and-forth that has the crowd moving. The upbeat energy of it all is infectious, and even *I*, Craig Doyle, start to sway and clap.

“What do you call this music?” I called up to a tall man to my right.

“I dunno, maybe ska?” the man replied back with a thick, Boston accent.

“It’s called reggaeton!” a lady shouted, to which her friend replied, “No, it’s not!”

I don’t know what any of that is, so I don’t pursue the topic further.

Mismatched cardboard boxes are stacked on a table near the buskers, these boxes filled with uniform bottles of ‘green juice’, which have a white label and the Calypso logo on it. Taped to the table is a sign that reads:

**Calypso Green Drink**
**Ambrosia of the Gods**
**Only $3!**

And occasionally someone from the audience takes a bottle and drops some money into a sombrero under the table. The tall man from Boston does this as well, except he drops a $10 bill into the hat and grabs 3 bottles of Green Juice. When he returns, he holds one out to me.

“It’s spirulina,” he said. “Good for ya.”

I’m here in the subway at 10pm after following instructions from a spam email, and it’s a pinstriping kind of day, so I take one with a fumbled ‘thank you’. The label looks plain, homemade, and the words ‘Matcha Tea & Spirulina’ are presented under the logo. There’s no ingredient list or nutritional information on the back, just a ‘Mission Statement’, which reads much like Colt’s email.

*Are you tired of being a zombie?*
*Calypso Green Drink is the beverage for you, made with a unique blend of matcha green tea, spirulina, kale, mango, & shiitake mushrooms, Calypso will shake off the chains of the daily grind and make you feel alive again. Feel the music in your soul again, Friend.*
*Please Refrigerate after Opening*

The texture is strange at first, but the taste isn’t bad. The mango is nice. This bottle isn’t large and, feeling a little peckish, I drink the whole thing while I watch the performance, not wanting to seem rude or anything. I like this music, whatever it is, the energy feels good. I tap my foot to it, and I clap my hands. I wonder what kind of person Colt Herzwin is, to be in a band like this and to busk in the subway, and to make a beverage like Green Juice. I wonder what it would be like to be that person.

A proverbial lightbulb goes off in my head, and I pull out my little notebook with the Atlas moth and my reading glasses. This notebook is exclusively for ideas for my novel, and I open it to the first page where these words are written:

*My name is Craig Doyle and I’m writing a ground-breaking novel.*

And I add the following line:

*This a nonfiction novel about the people I meet.*

But then I remember that I told everyone my novel would be about insects, so I cross out ‘people’ with a single, straight line and add in ‘insects’. My page now looks like this:

*My name is Craig Doyle and I’m writing a ground-breaking novel. This is a nonfiction novel about the <s>people</s> insects I meet.*

And this second sentence seems so momentous, so powerful a statement that I feel the enthusiasm well up in my chest. I’m excited! And in that moment, I know that Colt Herzwin’s spam email really *were* a sign from God, who really *did* answer my prayers, trivial as they are in the grand scheme of the universe. And for a rare moment in my life, I feel like I’m in the place I’m supposed to be.

For a moment I relish this feeling, savoring it with Colt’s music in the background, the trumpet and sax so precise with the notes and negative space that they’re almost percussive. I am in love with this feeling, in love with the ska, and in love with spirulina green juice, and the feeling is so unfamiliar that it makes my head feel a little funny, a little wavy, but I don’t mind it. I feel my phone vibrate in my pocket and when I glance at the number, it’s Madison. I’m overwhelmed with love for my daughter and I want to tell her that, so I answer the call and step away from the blasting music.

“Hi, Junebug!”

“Dad? Dad, where are you? Why is it so loud? I called the house and you didn’t pick up.”

“O-oh, n-n, I mean, it’s nothing. I’m uhhhh,” I glance around, realizing this is a bit difficult to explain. “I’m j-just meeting a friend.”

A long pause follows. Madison is very good at long pauses.

“...What kind of ‘friend’?” she asks suspiciously. “Oh, God, dad – you’re not on that dating site again, are you?”

“No! N-no, it’s more like a… a business type of deal.”

I walk bent over, cupping my hands around the phone so I can talk and hear. Madison continues to ask questions and I tell her I’m at the subway to meet my friend, and she tells me to come home, it’s not safe to meet people at the subway. I tell her that’s true, but Colt is not a bad sort of guy, he’s a very talented musician. She asks what kind of business I could possibly have with a musician? And it’s my turn to pause awkwardly.

I glance towards the table of Calypso Green Juice and I notice something strange – a broad man with a hunched back like a wheel bug picking up a case of the beverage. He scans around in a suspicious way, then carries it off. I gasp at the audacity of it, bristling with indignation for Colt Herzwin, who suddenly feels like my best friend.

“I think someone just stole something,” I say into the phone.

“Oh, at the subway? What a shocker,” Madison retorts. “Listen, just go home, it’s not safe to be out this late. I’m getting worried.”

I hesitate; Madison is right, it is a bit unsafe, and did I just witness a theft? I look around, but no one seems to notice anything, and Colt Herzwin is still dancing around with his trumpet. I cast a glance at the tall man from Boston, but he’s staring at his phone now, bobbing his head slightly in time to the music.

“Dad?” Madison presses, and I don’t know what to say.
